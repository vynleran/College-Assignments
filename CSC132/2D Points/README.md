# Program: 2D Points

## Using the template provided on the class web site, your task in this programming assignment is to implement a 2D point class in Python. You must provide/address the following in the class:

- A 2D point is made up of an x-component and a y-component. Each component is a floating
point value;

- A constructor should initialize a point either with specified values for the x- and y-components or
the point (0.0,0.0) as default;

- Instance variables should be appropriately named (i.e., beginning with underscores);

- Accessors and mutators should provide read access of and write access to the instance variables;

- A function named dist should take two points as input and calculate and return the floating
point distance between the two points;

- A function named midpt should take two points as input and calculate and return the
midpoint of the two points; and

- A magic function should provide a string representation of a point in the format (x,y).

## Note that you must not modify the main part of the program; therefore, your output should look exactly like the following:

p1: (0.0,0.0)

p2: (3.0,0.0)

p3: (3.0,4.0)

distance from p1 to p2: 3.0

distance from p2 to p3: 4.0

distance from p1 to p3: 5.0

midpt of p1 and p2: (1.5,0.0)

midpt of p2 and p3: (3.0,2.0)

midpt of p1 and p3: (1.5,2.0)

p4: (1.5,2.0)

distance from p4 to p1: 2.5

## You should probably use the main part of the program and the provided output to help you design the class properly.

### To help clarify, here are some specifics and/or constraints:

1. Make sure that your 2D point class addresses all of the requirements listed above;

2. Pay attention to the input(s) and output(s) of the functions dist and midpt (i.e., make sure that
your code precisely matches their descriptions above);

3. Use the decorator method discussed in class for accessors and mutators to properly wrap the
instance variables;

4. You must include a meaningful header, use good coding style, use meaningful variable names,
and comment your source code where appropriate;

5. Your output should be exactly like the sample run shown above; and

6. You must submit your source code as a single .py file.
