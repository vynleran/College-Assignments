# Program: Fraction Enhance

## Your task in this programming assignment is to write a Python program that efficiently implements a fraction class. What does efficiently mean? Well, think through the problem so that you do not have to unnecessarily perform operations (as they can be costly). In addition, you should make use of any additional functions that reasonably encapsulate separate logical tasks. This is a part of good coding style.

## You must provide/address the following in the fraction class:

- A constructor that initializes fractions (with specified values for the numerator and denominator
or 0/1 as default);

- Appropriate accessors and mutators for the instance variables;

- Proper automatic reducing/simplifying of fractions when necessary;

- Prevention of a 0 denominator;

- Overloading of the arithmetic operators on fractions (i.e., the ability to add, subtract, multiply,
and divide fractions using the arithmetic operators +, â€“, *, and / respectively);

- A method that returns the floating point representation of a fraction; and

- A method that specifies how fractions should be displayed (e.g., via print).

## A template is provided that includes a main part of the program intended to test your fraction class. Here's a sample run of a correctly implemented fraction class:

f1: 0/1 (0.0)

f2: 5/8 (0.625)

f3: 3/4 (0.75)

f4: 1/1 (1.0)

f1: 5/4 (1.25)

f2: 0/1 (0.0)

f3: 25/16 (1.5625)

f4: 2/275 (0.00727272727273)

## To help clarify, here are some specifics and/or constraints:

1. You must include a meaningful header, use good coding style, use meaningful variable names,
and comment your source code where appropriate;

2. Your output should be exactly like the sample run shown above;

3. Therefore, you should not modify the main part of the program (at all); and

4. You must submit your source code as a single .py file.
