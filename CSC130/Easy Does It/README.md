# Program: Easy Does It

## Your task in this programming assignment is to write a simple Python program that prompts the user to enter his/her name and age, followed by output as show in the following sample run (user input is shown in bold black):

Please enter your first name: **"Dan"**

Please enter your last name: **"Druff"**

How old are you, Dan Druff? **22**

Hi, Dan. You are 22 years old.

Twice your age is 44.

Half your age is 11.0

## Here's output of another sample run (again, user input is shown in bold black):

Please enter your first name: **"Natalia"**

Please enter your last name: **"Romanova"**

How old are you, Natalia Romanova? **35**

Hi, Natalia. You are 35 years old.

Twice your age is 70.

Half your age is 17.5.

## To help clarify, here are some specifics and/or constraints:

1. Your output should be exactly like the sample runs shown above (of course, actual input values
and calculations will vary depending on the provided inputs);

2. You must include a meaningful header, use good coding style, use meaningful variable names,
and comment your source code where appropriate;

3. You must use the provided source code template; and

4. You must submit your source code as a single .py file.
How to use the provided template

## Wondering how to actually use the template provided for this programming assignment? Here are the steps to do so:

- Save the template by right-clicking on the link on the Web site (save it somewhere handy as a .py
file).

- Launch IDLE as shown in the lesson on Introduction to Computer Programming. This brings up
a Python shell, which is just an interactive environment to play around in.

- Open the template via File | Open (or Ctrl+O), and select the saved template. This opens it in a
separate window.

- Modify the template according to the program requirements.

- To launch your program, first save it via File | Save (or Ctrl+S), then run it via Run | Run Module
(or F5). This runs it in the Python shell.

- Make changes to your program as necessary, saving and running it as appropriate.

- Upload your final .py file when you are done!
