# Program: Easy Does It...Reloaded

## Your task in this programming assignment is to rewrite the previous Python program so that all 3 inputs and the final output are specified in 4 separate functions that are called from the main part of the program. The output is slightly different this time as well, specifically when asking for the age, we will not address the user by name. The following output of a sample run (user input is shown in bold black):

Please enter your first name: **"Dan"**

Please enter your last name: **"Druff"**

How old are you? **22**

Hi, Dan Druff. You are 22 years old.

Twice your age is 44.

Half your age is 11.0

## Here's output of another sample run (again, user input is shown in bold black):

Please enter your first name: **"Natalia"**

Please enter your last name: **"Romanova"**

How old are you? **35**

Hi, Natalia Romanova. You are 35 years old.

Twice your age is 70.

Half your age is 17.5.

## To help clarify, here are some specifics and/or constraints:

1- Getting user input for the first name must be implemented in a function that is called from the
main part of the program;

2- Getting user input for the last name must be implemented in a function that is called from the
main part of the program;

3- Getting user input for the age must be implemented in a function that is called from the main part
of the program;

4- Greeting the user with their first name, last name, and age, along with doubling the user’s age,
and also halving the user’s age must be implemented in ONE function that is called from the
main part of the program;

5- Your output should be exactly like the sample runs shown above (of course, actual input values
and calculations will vary depending on the provided inputs);

6- You must include a meaningful header, use good coding style, use meaningful variable names,
and comment your source code where appropriate;

7- You must use the provided source code template; and

8- You must submit your source code as a single .py file.
