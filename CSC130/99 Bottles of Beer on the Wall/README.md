# Program: 99 Bottles of Beer on the Wall

## Your task in this programming assignment is to rewrite the iterative version of the 99 Bottles of Beer on the Wall algorithm so that: (1) it is implemented recursively; and (2) the output produced is grammatically correct when the number of bottles of beer on the wall is one. Here's output of a sample run (from three bottles of beer on the wall) that has the grammatical error corrected:

### first loop:
3 bottles of beer on the wall.
3 bottles of beer.
Take one down, pass it around.
2 bottles of beer on the wall.
### second loop:
2 bottles of beer on the wall.
2 bottles of beer.
Take one down, pass it around.
1 bottle of beer on the wall.
### third loop:
1 bottle of beer on the wall.
1 bottle of beer.
Take one down, pass it around.
0 bottles of beer on the wall.

## To help clarify, here are some specifics and/or constraints:

1- You must rewrite the passSomeBeers function so that it implements the algorithm
recursively instead of iteratively (i.e., calls itself, breaking the problem down ultimately to a base
case, and uses no loops);

2- The grammatical error when the number of bottles of beer on the wall is one must be corrected;

3- You must use the provided source code template; and

4- You must submit your source code as a single .py file.
